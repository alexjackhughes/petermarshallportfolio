            Peter is easy to work with because he understands my requirements
            quickly and just gets on with it. His writing is well-researched, of
            great quality and in keeping with our tone of voice. Iâ€™ll certainly
            be using Peter again.

            Peter was extremely professional and helpful to us in redesigning
            our CRM strategy. He was able to quickly understand our tone of
            voice and deliver copy that was consistent with our other
            communications. I look forward to having the opportunity to work
            together with him again in the future.
