        About me
      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-3">I’m a freelance copywriter.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-3">
        I work extensively with B2B and B2C companies based in the US and the EU
        creating blogs, whitepapers, reports, web copy, and much more besides.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-3">
        Previously I was employed as a professional copywriter, proofreader, and
        copy editor at bespoke writing company Horizon Writing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-3">
        Prior to my employment I studied at Cardiff University, graduating with
        a first-class honours degree in Philosophy and a master’s degree in
        Modern European and Analytic Philosophy (distinction).
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-3">
        I also work as a freelance journalist, writing for local, national, and
        online publications (including MixMag, the world’s bestselling dance
        music magazine).
      </p>
